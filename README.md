# Lazy Rearrangement Planning in Confined Spaces

### Project Description
This research project tackles a challenging object rearrangement problem where top-down grasps are disallowed in confined workspaces such as shelves or fridges. Therefore, the problem is much harder than the tabletop one where top-down grasps simplify robot-object interactions and waive object-object collisions.
Below you can find a [Pybullet](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/) simulation example of a robot (Motoman SDA10F) being tasked to rearranging cylindrical objects in a cluttered and confined space (a cubic workspace with transparent glasses). The rearrangment goals can be user defined and here the goal is defined as rearranging all the objects so that the objects with the same color are aligned in the same column (similar to a grocery scenario where commercial products of the same category are rearranged to be aligned after customers randomly drop them somewhere).
